terminal-manager
================

It's an AutoHotkey script to manage putty terminals. The following shortcuts are availble:
* \<WIN\>-x: (where x is one of the number keys 1 -9) binds a terminal to this number; pressing \<WIN\>-x again will toggle this terminal
* \<CTRL\>-\<WIN\>-t: terminate the active terminal
* \<WIN\>-\<LEFT\> or \<WIN\>-\<RIGHT\>: moves the terminal to another monitor
